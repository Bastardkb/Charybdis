This is a 3D printed holder for 3mm ceramic balls to use as static bearings for any trackball design.

It has been designed as an exact dimensional copy of the 7.5mm Veichu VCN310 BTU (Ball Transfer Unit). So any trackball design that was designed for these Veichu BTU's, will also take these holders for static bearings.

For use with 3mm Zirconium Oxide or Silicon Nitride balls - or any 3mm ball I suppose, but the ceramics mentioned are most commonly used for static trackball bearings.

These holders have been tested to work when printed in MJF from JLCPCB. Different printing techniques have different tolerances, so your results may vary when printed using different techniques.
