# Charybdis


An ergonomic keyboard with integrated trackball.

Engineered to be a full mouse replacement solution with high-quality, custom-developed components.

There are 4x6, 3x6 "Mini" and 3x5 "Nano" versions.

Made to be used with the [Scylla](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Scylla), [TKB Mini](https://github.com/Bastardkb/TBK-Mini) or [Skeletyl](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Skeletyl) on the other half.

## 3d prints - cases

The STL files are included in this Github repository, in the `files` folder.

Please find detailed instructions on how to print the case on the online instructions linked below.


Depending on which keyboard you are building, you will need different prints. There is a list in the table below - depending on the version number, the names will slightly vary. 

This repository is always updated with the latest version of the 3d models, and they are compatible with previous versions. For example, `charybdis.stl` might reference `charybdis3_v131.stl`.

**3d prints - 4x6**

*If you are printing tents, there are multiple ones available for the Charybdis Nano. We recommend using the latest design which is the strongest and easiest to print - the alien version. There are both 30 and 15 degree versions available.
